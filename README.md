# ðŸš— Ride & Transport Management System â€” C++ Console App

This is a console-based **Ride and Transport Management System** developed in C++ as a part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project. The system demonstrates core OOP principles and showcases **21 distinct features**, including ride creation, booking, route management, user profiles, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project simulates a simple ride and transport service, similar to how Uber or a university ride-sharing system might work, built entirely using object-oriented principles in C++. The system supports multiple user roles (driver, passenger, admin) and allows management of rides, vehicles, and bookings from a terminal interface.
